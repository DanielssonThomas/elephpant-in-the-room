        'infotext' => "The 2005–06 season was the 108th season of competitive football played by Arsenal. It was the final season in which home matches were played at the club's Highbury stadium after 93 years; Arsenal intended to move to its new 60,000 capacity Emirates Stadium in time for the following season. The club ended their Premier League campaign in fourth, having pipped local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to the position on the final day. Arsenal became the first London club to reach a UEFA Champions League final, though lost 2–1 to Barcelona in Paris. In the League Cup the club was eliminated in the semi-finals on aggregate score by Wigan Athletic and knocked out of the FA Cup, against Bolton Wanderers in the fourth round.

    Before the season commenced midfielder Patrick Vieira was sold to Juventus; striker Thierry Henry assumed his club captaincy role. Alexander Hleb was purchased from Stuttgart for an undisclosed fee in July 2005; in the winter transfer window Arsenal signed midfielder Abou Diaby, and forwards Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott.
    
    Arsenal lost to league champions Chelsea in the 2005 FA Community Shield at the Millennium Stadium. An indifferent start in the league saw Arsenal peak in second position after 13 matches, but a run of three consecutive defeats a month later had effectively ruled them out of title contention. On the final day, they beat Wigan Athletic 4–2 at Highbury; Tottenham Hotspur's defeat at West Ham United meant Arsenal secured fourth place. The team's performances in Europe were more striking; they eliminated Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal in the knockout stages. In the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final held at the Stade de France in Paris on 17 May 2006, goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off for a professional foul on Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o. Although defender Sol Campbell gave Arsenal a first half lead from a set piece, the team conceded twice in the final 15 minutes to lose the match.
    
    To mark the final season at Highbury, Arsenal held a valedictory campaign titled 'Highbury – The Final Salute'. The club staged several themed matchdays and a redcurrant home kit replaced the common red to honour the shirts worn in 1913.",

    Ironically, England have Germany to thank this morning for diverting attention from their disappointing EURO 2000™ campaign. But even in the demise of their arch-rivals there is scant comfort to be drawn. The German exit is news because of the country's incredible record in international competition, England have merely failed to make an impact at the European Championship again.
    History of failure
    Consider England's record in the championships since they first entered in 1968 and lost to Yugoslavia in the semi-final. In 1972 and 1974 they failed to qualify for the final stages, in 1980 they finished third in their group, they failed to qualify again in 1984, lost every game in 1988 and finished bottom of their group in 1992. They did, of course, progress to one of the most epic semi-finals of all in 1996, but this was on home soil. Before last Saturday's 1-0 win over Germany, you have to go back to 1980 for the last time England won a game in the finals on foreign soil, when goals from Trevor Brooking and Tony Woodcock secured a 2-1 victory against Spain.",

Leading the domestic Serie A championship a long way into the season, Fiorentina's title charge fell to pieces, as it lost unnecessary points while eventual champions Milan and runners-up Lazio continued winning their matches. In the end, Fiorentina salvaged third place in the league, qualifying for the UEFA Champions League in 1999–2000.

    Its European adventure in 1998–99 however, ended early, when a handmade bomb was thrown at a linesman in the victory against Swiss side Grasshoppers. The linesman escaped serious injury, but Fiorentina were declared losers of the match, despite its victory on the pitch, and were thus thrown out of the tournament. However, it avoided further sanctions. Fiorentina also lost the Coppa Italia Final to Parma, marking another season without titles.
    
    Several players were impressive, with the trio Gabriel Batistuta, Rui Costa and Francesco Toldo being the players really standing out. The defensive line-up and the many goals conceded were the main reasons Fiorentina would not win the title.",

        'infotext' => "The final was held on 12 July 1998 at the Stade de France, Saint-Denis. France defeated holders Brazil 3–0, with two goals from Zinedine Zidane and a stoppage time strike from Emmanuel Petit. The win gave France their first World Cup title, becoming the sixth national team after Uruguay, Italy, England, West Germany and Argentina to win the tournament on their home soil. They also inflicted the second-heaviest World Cup defeat on Brazil, later to be topped by Brazil's 7–1 defeat by Germany in the semi-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

    The pre-match build up was dominated by the omission of Brazilian striker Ronaldo from the starting lineup only to be reinstated 45 minutes before kick-off. He managed to create the first open chance for Brazil in the 22nd minute, dribbling past defender Thuram before sending a cross out on the left side that goalkeeper Fabien Barthez struggled to hold onto. France however took the lead after Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos conceded a corner from which Zidane scored via a header. Three minutes before half-time, Zidane scored his second goal of the match, similarly another header from a corner. The tournament hosts went down to ten men in the 68th minute as Marcel Desailly was sent off for a second bookable offence. Brazil reacted to this by making an attacking substitution and although they applied pressure France sealed the win with a third goal: substitute Patrick Vieira set up his club teammate Petit in a counterattack to shoot low past goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel.
    
    French president Jacques Chirac was in attendance to congratulate and commiserate the winners and runners-up respectively after the match. Several days after the victory, winning manager Aimé Jacquet announced his resignation from the French team with immediate effect.",

    Förlust med 4–2 borta mot Manchester United i första matchen följdes av seger hemma mot Barcelona efter att IFK Göteborg vänt 0–1 till 2–1 under sista kvarten. Målen gjordes av Magnus Erlingmark och Jesper Blomqvist. Därefter såg Erlingmark med sina båda mål till att det blev två 1–0-segrar över Galatasaray. Avancemanget till kvartsfinalen säkrades tack vare en 3–1-seger över Manchester United på Ullevi. Blomqvist gav Blåvitt en tidig ledning, men Mark Hughes kvitterade i andra halvlek. Erlingmark gjorde dock 2–1 precis efter kvitteringen, och strax därefter satte Pontus Kåmark 3–1 på straff. I sista gruppspelsmatchen, mot Barcelona på Camp Nou, tog hemmalaget ledningen med knappt tio minuter kvar, men precis som på Ullevi gjorde IFK Göteborg mål i 90:e minuten, denna gång genom Stefan Rehn. I kvartsfinalen mötte IFK Göteborg Bayern München. Första mötet slutade mållöst och i returen på Ullevi gjorde tyskarna två mål i andra halvlek, men Blåvitt gjorde återigen ett par sena mål och lyckades kvittera till 2–2. Målskyttar var Mats Lilienberg och Mikael Martinsson. Bayern gick dock till semifinal tack vare fler gjorda mål på bortaplan.",

        'infotext' => "The 1990–91 season was the 99th season in Liverpool F.C.'s existence, and their 29th consecutive year in the top flight. The season saw the club unable to defend its league title and did not reclaim the title for another thirty years until the 2019–20 season.

    Manager Kenny Dalglish resigned on 22 February 1991 following a dramatic 4–4 draw with local rivals Everton, citing personal reasons for his decision. With caretaker Ronnie Moran in charge, Liverpool failed to regain the lead of the First Division from Arsenal, who finished as champions having lost just one game all season. However, the club was still able to secure another top-two finish for a record 10th season in succession. Graeme Souness was appointed manager on 16 April for the five last matches of the season, resulting in three wins and two defeats.
    
    Captain Alan Hansen, out of action for a nearly a year, announced his retirement as a player not long after Dalglish's resignation.
    
    The season had started very well for the Reds, who as defending league champions won their first eight league games, including a 4–0 victory over Manchester United at Anfield, and enjoyed a 15-match unbeaten start in the league.
    
    It was also the final season at Anfield for striker Peter Beardsley, who enjoyed a fine start to his fourth season at the club but was then dropped in favour of new signing David Speedie halfway through the season. Both players left the club in the close season; Speedie to Blackburn Rovers and Beardsley to local rivals Everton. Also on their way out of Anfield that summer were defenders Gary Gillespie and Steve Staunton to Celtic and Aston Villa respectively. The close season saw Liverpool pay a national record £2.9million for Derby County striker Dean Saunders, who had been one of the First Division's top scorers in 1990–91 despite his team being relegated in bottom place. A further £2.5million went to the East Midlanders for England defender Mark Wright. An outlay of £1.25million also went on midfielder Mark Walters, who followed Souness to Anfield from Rangers.
    
    Just weeks before his resignation, Dalglish invested for the future with a move for 17-year-old AFC Bournemouth midfielder Jamie Redknapp, while fellow teenage midfielder Steve McManaman made his first two senior appearances during the season. He also gave a senior debut to 18-year-old winger Steve McManaman just before Christmas.",

    Mexico has qualified to seventeen World Cups and has qualified consecutively since 1994, making it one of six countries to do so. The Mexico national team, along with Brazil are the only two nations to make it out of the group stage over the last seven World Cups. Mexico played France in the first match of the first World Cup on 13 July 1930. Mexico's best progression in World Cups has been reaching the quarter-finals in both the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, both of which were staged on Mexican soil.
    
    Mexico is historically the most successful national team in the CONCACAF region, having won eleven confederation titles, including eight CONCACAF Gold Cups and three CONCACAF Championships (the precursor to the Gold Cup), as well as two NAFC Championships, one North American Nations Cup, one CONCACAF Cup and two gold medals of the Central American and Caribbean Games. It is one of eight nations to have won two of the three most important football tournaments (the World Cup, Confederations Cup, and Summer Olympics), having won the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Mexico is also the only team from CONCACAF to have won an official FIFA competition, winning the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup. Although Mexico is under the jurisdiction of CONCACAF, the national team was regularly invited to compete in the Copa América from 1993 to 2016, finishing runner-up twice – in 1993 and 2001 – and obtaining the third-place medal on three occasions.",

Frédéric Kanouté doubled West Ham's lead in the 59th minute, before Wimbledon pulled one back after 75 minutes with a 25-yard volley from former Hammer Michael Hughes.

    West Ham's heaviest defeat of the season came on 1 April when they were demolished by table-toppers and eventual champions Manchester United. Wanchope opened the scoring in the 11th minute but Manchester United proceeded to score seven, including a Paul Scholes hat-trick.
    
    This sparked West Ham into a run of three straight wins, culminating with their biggest win of the season on 22 April, when they beat Coventry City 5–0. Di Canio scored in the 48th and 67th minutes, with the other goals coming from Michael Carrick, Javier Margas and Kanouté.
