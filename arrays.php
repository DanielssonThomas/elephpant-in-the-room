The club ended their Premier League campaign in fourth, having pipped local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to the position on the final day. Arsenal became the first London club to reach a UEFA Champions League final, though lost 2–1 to Barcelona in Paris. In the League Cup the club was eliminated in the semi-finals on aggregate score by Wigan Athletic and knocked out of the FA Cup, against Bolton Wanderers in the fourth round.
    
    Arsenal lost to league champions Chelsea in the 2005 FA Community Shield at the Millennium Stadium. An indifferent start in the league saw Arsenal peak in second position after 13 matches, but a run of three consecutive defeats a month later had effectively ruled them out of title contention. <br>
    
    To mark the final season at Highbury, Arsenal held a valedictory campaign titled 'Highbury – The Final Salute'. The club staged several themed matchdays and a redcurrant home kit replaced the common red to honour the shirts worn in 1913.",

    Brazil played until the Quarter Finals, where they were defeated by France on penalties. <br>
    <br>The 1986 FIFA World Cup was the 13th FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial football tournament for men's senior national teams. It was played in Mexico from 31 May to 29 June 1986. The tournament was the second to feature a 24-team format. Colombia had been originally chosen to host the competition by FIFA but, largely due to economic reasons, was not able to do so, and resigned in 1982. Mexico was selected as the new host in May 1983, and became the first country to host the World Cup more than once.

The World Cup was won by Argentina (their second title, after winning in 1978). Argentina was captained by the 25-year old Diego Maradona, who played a large part in his team's success by scoring the 'Hand of God' goal, as well as another voted 'Goal of the Century', in the same quarter-final against England.",

    Ironically, England have Germany to thank this morning for diverting attention from their disappointing EURO 2000™ campaign. But even in the demise of their arch-rivals there is scant comfort to be drawn. The German exit is news because of the country's incredible record in international competition, England have merely failed to make an impact at the European Championship again.
    History of failure
    Consider England's record in the championships since they first entered in 1968 and lost to Yugoslavia in the semi-final. In 1972 and 1974 they failed to qualify for the final stages, in 1980 they finished third in their group, they failed to qualify again in 1984, lost every game in 1988 and finished bottom of their group in 1992. They did, of course, progress to one of the most epic semi-finals of all in 1996, but this was on home soil. Before last Saturday's 1-0 win over Germany, you have to go back to 1980 for the last time England won a game in the finals on foreign soil, when goals from Trevor Brooking and Tony Woodcock secured a 2-1 victory against Spain.",

Leading the domestic Serie A championship a long way into the season, Fiorentina's title charge fell to pieces, as it lost unnecessary points while eventual champions Milan and runners-up Lazio continued winning their matches. In the end, Fiorentina salvaged third place in the league, qualifying for the UEFA Champions League in 1999–2000.

    Its European adventure in 1998–99 however, ended early, when a handmade bomb was thrown at a linesman in the victory against Swiss side Grasshoppers. The linesman escaped serious injury, but Fiorentina were declared losers of the match, despite its victory on the pitch, and were thus thrown out of the tournament. However, it avoided further sanctions. Fiorentina also lost the Coppa Italia Final to Parma, marking another season without titles.
    
    Several players were impressive, with the trio Gabriel Batistuta, Rui Costa and Francesco Toldo being the players really standing out. The defensive line-up and the many goals conceded were the main reasons Fiorentina would not win the title.",

The win gave France their first World Cup title, becoming the sixth national team after Uruguay, Italy, England, West Germany and Argentina to win the tournament on their home soil. They also inflicted the second-heaviest World Cup defeat on Brazil, later to be topped by Brazil's 7–1 defeat by Germany in the semi-finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

    France took the lead after Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos conceded a corner from which Zidane scored via a header. Three minutes before half-time, Zidane scored his second goal of the match, similarly another header from a corner. The tournament hosts went down to ten men in the 68th minute as Marcel Desailly was sent off for a second bookable offence. Brazil reacted to this by making an attacking substitution and although they applied pressure France sealed the win with a third goal: substitute Patrick Vieira set up his club teammate Petit in a counterattack to shoot low past goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel.",

    Förlust med 4–2 borta mot Manchester United i första matchen följdes av seger hemma mot Barcelona efter att IFK Göteborg vänt 0–1 till 2–1 under sista kvarten.

    Manager Kenny Dalglish resigned on 22 February 1991 following a dramatic 4–4 draw with local rivals Everton, citing personal reasons for his decision. With caretaker Ronnie Moran in charge, Liverpool failed to regain the lead of the First Division from Arsenal, who finished as champions having lost just one game all season. However, the club was still able to secure another top-two finish for a record 10th season in succession. Graeme Souness was appointed manager on 16 April for the five last matches of the season, resulting in three wins and two defeats.
    
    Captain Alan Hansen, out of action for a nearly a year, announced his retirement as a player not long after Dalglish's resignation.
